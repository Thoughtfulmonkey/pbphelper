### Copying status text for a round

**Note**: The application outputs text formatted for block initiative. For example, if the next two creatures to act belong to players, both will be highlighted as able to act. If the order of the initiative is a player, and then an enemy, only the player is highlighted to act.

1. At the top of the encounter page, select the copy icon.
2. In the lower right corner, select the scratch pad icon.

### Entering the results of a dice roll

After the virtual dice have been rolled in the encounter template, you can enter those results back into the application.

**Important**: The hit result will be compared against the target's EAC or KAC, depending on the damage type, and damage automatically applied on a success. Damage will be applied to stamina first, and then hit points. If the damage is direct to HP, or EAC/KAC is adjusted due to an effect, take damage may be applied incorrectly.

2. In the **Hit** field, enter the result of the roll to hit.
3. In the **Damage** field, enter the result of the damage roll.
4. Select **Save**.

### Entering an unprepared attack

In most cases, a player will enter the attack details in the PbP platform, and the rolls will be made immediately. In these cases, you can enter the attack directly into the application.

1. Select the pencil icon in the creature's row.
2. In the **Enter an action** panel, turn on **Attack**.
3. From the tags underneath the **Target** field, select the target of the attack.
4. In the **Hit** field, enter the result of the roll to hit.
5. In the **Damage** field, enter the result of the damage roll.
6. In the **Type** field, enter the appropriate abbreviate for the damage type.

### Editing the JSON

**Warning**: There is no backup of an encounter. You could accidentally break the entire encounter. A check is performed when you save the JSON to check that it is valid. However, being valid does not mean that it is in the correct format for the application or contains all of the required data.
