# Play by post helper

A tool to help manage Starfinder games played by post. The core functionality is combat tracker. It's intended to be used in conjunction with a Playby Post platform, such as the Paizo forums or Discord.

## Requirements

This is a web application. You'll require a sever that meets the following requirements:

* PHP: 8.3.0 tested. Minimum of PHP 8.0 required.
* MySQL: 8.2.0 tested
* PDO driver: Almost certainly included in your PHP installation.

You can easily test or run the PbP helper locally through a local server. For example, https://www.uniformserver.com/.

**Note**: PHP 8.0 is required because the [str_starts_with](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-starts-with.php) function is used. You could replace it if you need to use an earlier version of PHP.

## Installation

1. Create a database on the server.
2. Create a user account that has CREATE, SELECT, INSERT, and UPDATE priviledges for the database. In the near future, most likely DELETE as well.
3. Copy the contents of the distribution folder to a folder on your server. You can name the folder on your server anything that you want.
4. In a browser, access the /setup/index.php file.
5. Enter all of the required information, and then select **Submit**.

If the installation completes sucessfully, delete the setup setup/index.php file from your server.

If anything goes wrong, correct the issue, drop any tables that were created, and then try again.

## Security

Security is minimal. The application is intended to be used by a single user and not contain any sensitive information.

When you install the application, you will set a "password". You use this password to access the application.

## Usage

* To access the application, go to the index page in a web browser.

The application has three main sections.

* [Encounter templates](./md_docs/encounter_template.md): These define the creatures that are included in a specific encounter.
* [Teams](./md_docs/teams.md): These define a group of adventurers.
* [Encounters](./md_docs/encounter.md): An initiative and round tracker that combines a team and an encounter.

You need to create encounter templates and teams as part of the setup, encounters are the main feature. For more information, use the links above.

## Data storage

The application uses a MySQL database, but the fields in the database are minimal. The data is mainly stored in JSON. For more information, see the following sections:

* [Encounter / team template structure](./md_docs/template_structure.md)
* [Encounter structure](./md_docs/encounter_structure.md)
